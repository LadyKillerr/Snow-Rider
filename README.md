## Snow-Rider
This project is a 2D Skating game written using the Unity game engine. This game was built primarily for self-educational purposes with guidance from [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)

# Gameplay Features
- You are Eddy, a professional stunt puller who has gone through many trials and errors seeking the thrill of life through reckless and dangerous risky sports... 

  This time you encountered the highest peek in the world, the World Holder - the world's highest snow mountain that comes with freezing wind, below zero temperature, and deadly slopes and hills of all kinds...

  What stunts will you pull this time? Will the legend thrive and prosper? Or will this be the last of his stunts? His fate falls into your hands...

- Press W to boost, S to slow down(you can't go backward), press A and D to tilt/ rotate, same goes with the arrow and press space to jump

- Remember, You are playing as the legendary stunt puller, try to do as many flip, rotate, tricks as you can. Make Eddy proud!

- Be careful, if you smack Eddy's head to the ground, Eddy will be seriously injured and not happy at all, so control your flipping!

  Uh Oh, got to be careful, Eddy cracks like an egg if his head got crashed into the snow

# Things I learned making this 2D skating game
- How to use sprite shapes
- Setup a basic follow camera using Cinemachine
- Using Surface Effector2D and Edge Collider
- Using AddTorque instead of .Rotate() to control Eddy
- Using SceneManagement and LoadScene() to reload a level
- Creating Delays using Invoke
- Learning the fundamentals of Particles, implementing Audio, and how to trigger them
- Learn how to use FindObjectOfType and set methods to public to access them from another script.
# And many many more while getting through making this project...
